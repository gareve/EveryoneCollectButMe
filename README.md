Game made for a  4 hour contest called Corona Blitz 2013.

Gameplay
========
Everyone on the Corona Blitz wants to collect their favorite
items but you. You hate it. Collect items is just not for you
But ... do you know what is more interesting???
Prevent that the other players of the Corona Blitz 2013
can collect successfully all their items within a time frame.

With the movements of your finger, you can move the player and
deflect the other players that want to collect items of their same color.

If some player collect all their items, you will lose.

The first level is easy, but can you beat the other two levels
when the other players get a new power? The power of temporary vanishment.
